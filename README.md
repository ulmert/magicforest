# Magic forest
Magic forest is a custom oscillator for the **Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1** capable of generating a true lo-fi forest experience, sprinkled with pan flute and claves.   

## Usage
A + B encoders are used to control the volume for pan flute + claves and ambience.
Accessing the oscillator parameters, each group can also be tuned individually.

Use latched arpeggiator (with a longer pattern length) for instant ambience - EG should be set to **Open** mode.

Upload [magicforest.ntkdigunit](magicforest.ntkdigunit) using the NTS-1 digital Librarian application.
